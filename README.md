## Week 1
### About CSV data
Directly load `1988.csv` and `1989.csv`, no need to run `shuf` again. They both contain 10001 lines which means the files have been already pre-processed.

### About `shuf` on Mac
You have to install `shuf` on your Mac: 

```
brew install coreutils
``` 
(Make sure you have installed [brew](https://brew.sh/) already).
